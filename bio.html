		<p>Greetings, citizen of the New Republic. I've never been a man of many words, as I let my piloting do the most of my talking. However, people with far more interest in biographies than I have did supply me with a site on the holonet. It has kept a record of my career up to this point and I can confirm its accuracy: <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wedge_Antilles">click this</a><br>

			<li>Home One</li>
			<li>Hosnian Prime</li>
		</ul><br>
		<q>You defied the Empire alone. You gave up the life and career you'd built rather than violate your principles. I'd call that brave.</q></p>
